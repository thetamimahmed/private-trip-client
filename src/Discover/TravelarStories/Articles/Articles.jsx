            <p className="text-xl text-black text-justify">The period between the Fourth of July and Labor Day is considered the peak summer vacation season in the U.S. Days are long, the sun is out, and everyone wants to get out of the house. But with flight prices high and a seemingly endless amount of destinations to consider, it can be hard to decide where to take your well-earned summer PTO. Whether youre looking for a domestic or international getaway, we’ve pulled together six destinations worthy of a visit between the two major summer holidays.</p>
            <h2 className="font-bold text-3xl my-5 text-black">Seattle</h2>
            <img src="https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/29/79/01/06/caption.jpg?w=800&h=-1&s=1" alt="" />

            Come summer, Seattle is bathed in sunlight, a much-needed respite from its infamous rain. With mild temperatures and plenty of outdoor activities, its the perfect destination for soaking up the Pacific Northwests natural beauty. </p>
            <p className="text-xl text-black my-5 text-justify">
            But first? Coffee (you are in the birthplace of Starbucks, after all). Instead of standing in line for the original Starbucks at Pike Place, make the 10-minute walk to Monorail Espresso. While they’ve got a brick-and-mortar now, Monorail is credited as the world’s first espresso cart, made in the most Seattle way possible, out of an old Boeing surplus shuttle cart.

            Then, it’s time to get outside. You have endless options, but we’re partial to The Chihuly Garden and Glass, best seen on sunny summer days when rays shine through the exquisite, ultra-colorful glass art installations. If you need more room to spread out (and let the kids run wild) amble through the free-to-enter Washington Park Arboretum, a 230-acre park with walking trails and a diverse collection of trees, plants, and flowers.
